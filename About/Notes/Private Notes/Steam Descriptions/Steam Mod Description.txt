Rimworld Genes Extended is a mod that enhances Expanded Biotech Style Genes, extends on other mods genes, along with making some new ones.

Some features that are in the works are some more genes for Super Hero Genes, along with genes for the mod "Godly Trait Genes".

As for why this requires royalty, that's because a good amount of the genes rely on psycast-based genes, and are interwoven enough that it's nigh-impossible to seperate them. Ideology-based ones can be isolated slightly easier, hence it's optional.
