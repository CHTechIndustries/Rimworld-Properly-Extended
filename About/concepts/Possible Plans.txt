gene for being out of phase?
abilities that require archites? (pawn can absorb archites, then use them)
random teleport while moveing

Added in a gene that makes the comfortable tempature 0 degrees
Added a gene that inverts the comfortable tempatures
a category for "impossible" genes (like the 3 following ones)
	-a gene to make the base comfortable tempature precisly 0
	-a gene that multiples comfortable tempature by 0, so no matter what, only 0 degrees is comfortable
	-invert comfortable tempatures, so there is literally no comfortable temp (an example of a result is the tempature must be bellow -30 and above 8 (in which case without that gene it would be above -8 and bellow 30)
